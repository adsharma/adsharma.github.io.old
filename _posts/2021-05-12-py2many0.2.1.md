## py2many 0.2.1

[py2many](http://github.com/adsharma/py2many/) [version 0.2.1](https://pypi.org/project/py2many/) is out!

### Recent improvements

* 231 tests in 7 languages pass. As in generated code is human readable, compiles, runs and produces the same output as python3.
* Improved CI: 84% code coverage
* C++ code tested with g++ as well as clang
* Preliminary async support in rust
* Ternary operator supported
* Python docstrings show up as comments in the target language
* Benchmarking with langcomp benchmark shows 100x perf improvement by using `rustc -O`

### Future Plans

* Show how to speed up python code by transpiling and using pyO3 to generate python modules
* Demonstrate robust/secure file parsing capabilities
* Document supported subset
* Implement functional primitives - mainly pattern matching
* Improve ergonomics of the source python where possible

Are there other features you think py2many should prioritize? Do drop me a line.
