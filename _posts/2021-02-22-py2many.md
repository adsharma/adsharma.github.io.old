## py2many transpiler

[py2many](http://github.com/adsharma/py2many/) is a python -> {c++14, rust, go, julia, kotlin, dart, nim} transpiler written in python.

### Recent improvements

* IntEnum/IntFlag support: rust/go/nim support it. The other languages need work.
* Integer overflow mitigation: most languages now use inferred types as opposed to defering to lanugage specific type inference (e.g. C++ `auto`).
* Streamline function call dispatch and remove the copy-pasta from pyrs

### Future Plans

There are several transpiler projects that once had a large mindshare, but have petered out after several years of inactivity.

* grumpy
* rusthon
* py2nim
* py2jl

among others. Trying to learn from their experiences and finding potential collaborators is going to take time.

In the meanwhile, I'm thinking of a few potential directions:

* Plugin system to write user defined function maps. Look for `small_dispatch_map` in the code for examples.
* Map python module system to other languages
* Write a small runtime. Golang doesn't have an ergonomic `range(3, 9, 2)` for example.

Are there other features you think py2many should prioritize? Do drop me a line.
